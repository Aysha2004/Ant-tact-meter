## 🔧 Technical Details

### Ant Detection Methods
1. **API Detection**: Uses Google Gemini AI for accurate counting (requires API key)
2. **Fallback Detection**: 
   - **Images**: Analyzes pixel patterns to detect dark areas (typical ant colors)
   - **Videos**: Motion detection to identify moving objects

### Algorithm Improvements
- Enhanced pixel analysis for better ant detection
- Motion intensity calculation for video analysis
- Confidence scoring based on detection patterns
- Activity level assessment

## 🎯 MVP Features (Hackathon Ready)

✅ **Core Functionality**
- Image and video upload
- Automatic ant counting
- Results visualization with charts
- User-friendly interface

🚧 **Future Enhancements** (Coming Soon)
- Predict ant actions
- Measure food delivery time
- Track ant interactions
- Advanced AI analysis

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application works on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

## 🔑 API Configuration (Optional)

To use the AI-powered ant detection:
1. Get a Google Gemini API key
2. Replace the API_KEY in `backend/script.js`
3. Uncomment the API detection code

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **No Setup Required**: Just open the HTML files in a web browser
2. **Local Development**: Use a local server for best performance
3. **File Upload**: Test with ant images or videos
4. **Results**: View the analysis and charts

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

- Use clear, well-lit images
- Ensure ants are visible and not too close together
- For videos, use steady camera work
- Higher resolution files work better
- Good contrast between ants and background

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Detection accuracy depends on image quality
- Multiple ants close together may be counted as one
- Very small ants may not be detected
- API detection requires internet connection
