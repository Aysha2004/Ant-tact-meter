# Ant-Tact Meter üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: BitVerse


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Anjana C - TocH
- Member 2: Aysha Sulthana - TocH

### Project Description
Ant Tact Meter is a fun web application that lets users upload images or videos of ants to automatically count them, estimate their average food delivery time, and provide amusing insights into their behavior. It uses JavaScript, Chart.js, and an AI/API for detection, displaying results with interactive charts and summaries.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Humans never really track how ants deliver food or interact in colonies ‚Äî but wouldn‚Äôt it be hilarious to know who‚Äôs slacking and who‚Äôs hustling in the ant world?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built Ant Tact Meter! Users upload ant images or videos, and our app magically counts the ants, guesses what they‚Äôre doing, and estimates how long it takes them to deliver food ‚Äî all while showing colorful charts and amusing summaries for maximum entertainment.

## Technical Details

The demo shows how a user interacts with Ant Tact Meter: starting from the landing page, selecting an analysis feature, uploading an image or video of ants, and finally viewing the results. The app automatically counts the ants, provides a fun summary of their behavior, and displays charts showing activity or estimated food delivery time.
