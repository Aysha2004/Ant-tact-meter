Project Description
A web application that lets users upload images or videos of ants to automatically count ants, estimate their average food delivery time, and provide fun insights about their behavior.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody actually tracks how ants deliver food or interact in colonies manually ‚Äî but wouldn‚Äôt it be fun to know?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built Ant Tact Meter! Users upload ant images or videos, and the app:
- Counts ants automatically
- Gives a funny summary of what the ants are doing
- Estimates average food delivery time in a colony
All results are visualized with charts for maximum ‚Äúscientific‚Äù effect.
